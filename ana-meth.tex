\chapter{Analysis and methodology}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Go into more detail on the \textbf{relevant} theory behind \textbf{relevant} SOTA approaches mentioned previously.
	\item present the neural network approaches as mere examples of sequence transduction.
	\item Move toward the theory behind neural network sequence transduction.
	\item discuss the very active field of neural machine translation.
	\item steer discussion toward the transformer architecture - the SOTA in NMT.
	\item discuss clustering, as assistance to the forecasting system.
	\item somehow, it needs to go from "this is some theory about stuff that does stuff" to "this is the system that will be used"
