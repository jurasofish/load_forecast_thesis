\chapter{Case study}
This chapter presents a case study where the load forecasting system is applied to Bruny Island.
As discussed in section \ref{scope} (\nameref{scope}), the aim of this case study is to develop a load forecasting system which can predict future load based on weather, holiday periods, car movement, and other factors. 
Bruny Island and the NAC will be used as a case study. 
The forecasting system will be equally applicable to any power system network, \hl{and this will be demonstrated later in this chapter}.
\\
Specifically, the system will have the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The system will produce a forecast up to 24 hours in the future in 15- to 60-minute intervals. This will be a rolling forecast that can be re-calculated at any time.
	\item The forecast will be able to begin from any point time.
	\item The forecast will predict load in MVA at each interval.
	\item The forecast system will be aimed at predicting aggregate load at the feeder level. That is, between approximately 0.5 and 10MVA.
	\item The forecast system will be especially tuned to predict load during holiday periods.
\end{itemize}

\section{Data analysis}
In section \ref{pattens-profiles} the general properties of load profiles and how they are influenced by exogenous factors was discussed. Now, these general properties will be investigated for the particular feeder in the case study.
