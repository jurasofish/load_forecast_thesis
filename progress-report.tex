\section{Project aims}
The project aims have not changed since the proposal.
The aim of this project is to build upon existing research and develop a load forecasting system which can predict future load based on weather, holiday periods, car movement, and other factors. 
Bruny Island and the NAC will be used as a case study. 
The forecasting system is expected to be equally applicable to any power system network.
\\
Specifically, the system will have the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The system will produce a forecast up to 24 hours in the future in 15- to 60-minute intervals. This will be a rolling forecast that can be re-calculated at any time.
	\item The forecast will be able to begin from any point time.
	\item The forecast will predict load in kVA at each interval.
	\item The forecast system will be aimed at predicting aggregate load at the feeder level. That is, between approximately 0.5 and 10MVA.
	\item The forecast system will be especially tuned to predict load during holiday periods.
\end{itemize}
