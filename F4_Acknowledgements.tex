\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank firstly my supervisors, Evan Franklin and Michael Negnevitsky, for their continued support, insight, and (often-ignored) suggestions throughout the year.

Secondly, Paul Scott for taking the forecasting system and implementing it as part of the battery trial, and for managing the weather forecast data.

Thirdly, Andrew Fraser, Laura Jones and the rest of TasNetworks for their guidance on requirements and assistance with data.
